## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about the intersection of football and data, I help organizations turn insights into decisions that drive growth, engagement, and performance.

Currently Head of Analytics at 433 | 433 Impact, I lead a talented team to optimize monetization across app and web platforms, deliver actionable insights, and foster a data-driven culture. My expertise spans Power BI, SQL, AdOps, and Data Science, with a track record of translating complex analytics into clear, impactful strategies.

My career journey has taken me from global brands like Nike, Lâ€™OrÃ©al, and Boston Scientific to the fast-paced world of digital sports media. Along the way, Iâ€™ve built predictive models, designed dashboards used across organizations, and led initiatives that boosted both revenue and fan experience.

Outside of work, my Masterâ€™s thesis was published in the Academy of Management Journal, examining how temporary policy changes during the Brazilian World Cup reshaped societal norms. Before my analytics career, I earned a football scholarship to play at Concordia University in Montreal an experience that continues to fuel my passion for the game.

My goal: use data to tell the story behind the game, and help teams on and off the pitch make winning decisions.
